This testbench has three operation modes:

# **Simple mode**: 

It runs in this current directoy any program located at ./software/app.
By running the run.sh script, you select ine application, compile it, and copy the code.txt 
file to the current dir for simulation. After the simulation is finished, the sv_debug.txt
file will have the output of the program.

- syntax
	* ./run.sh <name_of_the_application>

- example
	* ./run.sh fib
	* cat sv_debug.txt

# **Batch mode**: 



# **Random program mode**: 

The directory testcases has a list of testcases which are run in sequence.
The difference compared to the previous mode is the ability to run several tests in sequence and,
at the end, generate a combined code coverage metrics. See the file testcases/run_all.sh to 
see how it works.


- example
	* cd testcases
	* ./run-all.sh
